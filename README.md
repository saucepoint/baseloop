# *baseloop* üîµüîÅ

*Using Compound III to one-click leverage on cbETH (up to 10x!!!)*

---

Gas efficient with minimal "trips":
1. Flash loan cbETH from Balancer, to the desired level of exposure
2. Supply (collateralize) cbETH on Compound III
3. Borrow ETH on Compound III
4. Swap ETH for cbETH on Uniswap V3
5. Repay the flash loan (cbETH)

---

## Usage

### The one-click leverage does not have a UI. You will need to use *basescan*

* [cbETH APY Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mLf3QrqNqqyDjQtOqL1UxRTSkgItmWxmjMAqI8ppAnw)
* [Basescan contract](https://basescan.org/address/0xD342096DC2271efE68E63aF4F5EBf5A6C9cB9Ee9)

<summary>üëâAllow Baseloop to manage your Compound balances</summary>

For Baseloop to work, you must approve it as an operator/manager of your Compound account. This is not available on Basescan. You can allow permissions `cWETHv3.allow(Baseloop, true)` with:

1. Send 0 ether and this calldata to Compound's Base address: 0x46e6b214b524310239732D51387075E0e70970bf
   ```
   0x110496e5000000000000000000000000d342096dc2271efe68e63af4f5ebf5a6c9cb9ee90000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
   ```
   which comes from:
   ```
   cast calldata "allow(address,bool)" 0xD342096DC2271efE68E63aF4F5EBf5A6C9cB9Ee9 true
   ```
2. or:
    ```bash
    cast send 0x46e6b214b524310239732D51387075E0e70970bf "allow(address,bool)" 0xD342096DC2271efE68E63aF4F5EBf5A6C9cB9Ee9 true --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org --interactive

**[adjustPosition](https://basescan.org/address/0xD342096DC2271efE68E63aF4F5EBf5A6C9cB9Ee9#writeContract#F1)**

Adjust your position up or down

    - payableAmount: an amount of Ether to leverage on. Optional when modifying existing leverage

    - targetCollateraValue: the total desired amount of collateral value in Ether. Multiple payableAmount by leverage multiplier to get this number. Expressed with 18 decimals. 2.5e18 = 2.5 ether of total collateral value, 2500000000000000000

    - collateralFactor: desired collateral factor (or "loan-to-value"). Expressed with 18 decimals. 0.8e18 = 80% collateral factor, 800000000000000000

**[adjustPositionCBETH](https://basescan.org/address/0xD342096DC2271efE68E63aF4F5EBf5A6C9cB9Ee9#writeContract#F2)**

Leverage up using cbETH tokens (cannot deleverage with this function)

    - cbETHAmount: an amount of cbETH to leverage on

    - targetCollateral: the total desired amount of cbETH (as collateral on Compound). Expressed with 18 decimals. 2.5e18 = 2.5 cbETH of total collateral, 2500000000000000000

    - collateralFactor: desired collateral factor (or "loan-to-value"). Expressed with 18 decimals. 0.8e18 = 80% collateral factor, 800000000000000000


**[close](https://basescan.org/address/0xD342096DC2271efE68E63aF4F5EBf5A6C9cB9Ee9#writeContract#F3)**
* Fully unwind your leveraged position
* *optionally* provide some ETH to repay a portion of the loan
